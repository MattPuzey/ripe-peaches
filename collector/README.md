## Clean Architecture

This is the collector service for ripe peaches. This service is in charge of retrieving data from the web and placing it in the ripe peaches store. 

In terms of software architecture our initial aim is to put some clean architectures philosophy into 
practice. To make this easier to follow, our directory structure will map to 
layers of abstraction so that it's easy to identify which layers our modules sit underneath.
